      <p>Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them right? Its only when we wake up then we realize that something was
        actually strange. If we are gonna perform Inception then we need imagination.
        <q class="pull-quote">"You musn't be afraid to dream a little bigger darling."</q> No creeping doubts? Not feeling persecuted, Dom? Chased
        around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces, the way the projections persecute the dreamer? Admit
        it: you don't believe in one reality anymore. So choose. Choose to be here. Choose me. Great. Thank you. So, now
        we're trapped in Fischer's mind battling his own private army, and if we get killed, we'll be lost in limbo till
        our brains turn to scrambled egg. To wake up from that after, after years, after decades... after we'd become old
        souls thrown back into youth like that... I knew something was wrong with her. She just wouldn't admit it. Eventually,
        she told me the truth. She was possessed by an idea, this one, very simple idea, that changed everything. That our
        world wasn't real. That she needed to wake up to come back to reality, that, in order to get back home, we had to
        kill ourselves.</p>
